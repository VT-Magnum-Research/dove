Many of these samples come from the excellent 
Standard Task Graph (STG) at 
http://www.kasahara.elec.waseda.ac.jp/schedule/

We do not wish to re-distribute this set ourselves. 
What is provided here is a small number of graphs to 
help the beginner get started, please download the
original STG for all graphs and *DO NOT* put more 
STG graphs into our git project.
