The output MPI executable seems to require two more ranks than are shown in the 
rankfile, likely for the initial source task and the final sink task. Someone
needs to figure out if this guess is correct, and if it is then the rankfile 
generation should be updated to address this by placing the source and 
sink either randomly or semi-intelligently

Note that this is currently happening only because my deployments.xml file
contains only four mappings. If the final deployments.xml file contains six
mappings, then the generator will happily spit out six rankings
