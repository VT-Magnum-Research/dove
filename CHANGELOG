v0.2

In this version the pheromone matrix is {core * task}, and the ordering
of all tasks is fixed before the ants can run. Therefore the ants cannot
wander randomly through the graph, they must wander from column to column
in an increasing fashion. The first and last columns only have a single 
valid node, meaning that ants are literally wandering from start to end
trying to find the shortest path. 

v0.1

This version is the initial ACO, using the tour path as the 
final scheduling order. The pheromone matrix is of shape task*core, 
where tour[0] defines the first mapping and the first scheduling, 
and tour[1] defines the second mapping and the second scheduling, etc
